(defcustom magit-arcanist-arc-executable (executable-find "arc")
  "Path to the `arc' executable. `magit-arcanist-enable' will
fail if this path does not exist."
  :type 'string)

(defun magit-arcanist--run-arc-cmd (cmd &optional args)
  (apply #'magit-start-process magit-arcanist-arc-executable nil cmd args))

(provide 'magit-arcanist-run)
